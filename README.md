# CardDealingMachine
## This project proposed to solve a simple issue: Deal a number of cards to players.
## It is made using SolidWorks to design the 3D components of the actual system and Arduino to control the electronic pieces(Stepper motor, DC motor, drivers, 9V battery). The board is programmed using the Arduino laguage which is derived from C++ (the code is found in the .ino file). There also is attached a short documentation where you can find the final assembly of the machine and the electrical scheme.
